My Programming Language is a custom programming language designed to take your coding skills to the next level. It provides a simplified syntax inspired by languages like C# and Java, and it is implemented as an interpreter in Python.

## Features

- Simple and expressive syntax
- Lexer and parser for tokenizing and parsing code
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for representing the code structure
- Semantic analysis for type checking and symbol table management
- Code generation to transform the AST into executable code
- Basic standard library for common functions and utilities
- Error handling for better feedback on code issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PLY library (`pip install ply`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bonifacemwanza/codeForBread.git

2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. Run the main script:
   ```python main.py```
This will execute the test code defined in main.py and demonstrate the functionality of the programming language
